# webpack-simple-ts

webpack-simple을 기반으로 typescript를 추가하였습니다.

### Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init gongzza/webpack-simple-ts my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

### What's Included

- `npm run dev`: Webpack + `vue-loader` + `ts-loader` with proper config for source maps & hot-reload.

- `npm run build`: build with HTML/CSS/JS minification.

- `npm test`: test with [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/)

### Fork It And Make Your Own

You can fork this repo to create your own boilerplate, and use it with `vue-cli`:

```
